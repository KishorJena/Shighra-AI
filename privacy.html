        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p><em>Last Updated: March 10, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how "Shighra.ai" (the "Extension"), a Chrome extension developed by Kishor Jena, handles user data. The Extension is designed to provide a fast and efficient AI-powered chat assistant within your browser. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection and Storage</h3>
        <p>The Extension is designed to minimize data collection and maintain user privacy. Below is an overview of our approach:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Data Transmission</strong>: The Extension does not transmit any user data to external servers or cloud services. All operations occur locally on your device.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: User prompts, settings, and preferences are stored exclusively on your device using Chrome’s <code>chrome.storage.local</code> system, ensuring fast access and complete privacy.</li>
          <li><strong>API Key Usage</strong>: Initially, the Extension provides a default Groq API key to enable immediate functionality. Users may replace this with their own API key, entered via the Extension’s input field, to communicate with Groq’s AI service. Neither the default key nor your custom key is stored or accessed by us beyond its use within the Extension.</li>
          <li><strong>No Personal Data</strong>: The Extension does not collect or process personal or sensitive information, such as your name, email address, browsing history, or other identifiable data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How the Extension Operates</h3>
        <p>The Extension overlays an AI assistant on your active browser tab using Shadow DOM technology. This approach isolates the Extension’s interface from the webpage, preventing interference with the host page. When you submit a prompt, it is combined with a system prompt designed to ensure concise and relevant responses, consistent with our goal of providing quick and efficient assistance.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Integration</h3>
        <p>The Extension integrates with Groq to deliver AI functionality. When a prompt is submitted, it is sent to Groq’s API (along with our system prompt for brevity) using either the default API key we provide or the user-supplied key. No additional third parties are involved. For details on how Groq handles data, please refer to their Privacy Policy, available on their official website.</p>

        <h3>Policy Updates</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy reflects our current practices. Should we introduce changes in the future—such as adding server-side storage—we will revise this policy accordingly and notify users through the Extension’s update notes or other appropriate channels.</p>

        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        <p>For any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy or the Extension, please feel free to reach out. You may contact Kishor Jena via the following platforms:</p>
