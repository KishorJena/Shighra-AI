### Privacy Policy for Shighra AI

*Last Updated: August 11, 2025*

This document outlines the privacy practices for "Shighra AI" (the "Extension"). Our core commitment is to your privacy. Shighra AI is designed to be a powerful yet stateless tool that processes your requests without storing your personal data.

### Our Data Handling Philosophy

Shighra AI is engineered to be a "fire-and-forget" tool. **We do not store, save, or log any of your personal data, prompts, or activity.** The Extension holds data only for the brief moment it is needed to process your request and then discards it.

You are absolutely right. The goal is clarity and trust, and getting bogged down in technical details can work against that. Let's simplify it to be direct and non-technical.

Here is a much shorter and clearer version that focuses only on the most important point: **you do not store user data.**

### The Simplified Wording

Replace the entire "Local Storage for Application Data" bullet point with this single, powerful statement:

* **Stateless and Private by Design:** The Extension is designed to be stateless. It does **not** save, store, or log any of your prompts, conversation history, or personal data anywhere.

### The Fully Updated Section (Short & Clear)

Here is what the entire "How Your Data is Handled" section looks like with this new, simplified point.

### How Your Data is Handled

To provide its features, the Extension processes information in the following ways:

  * **Prompts and Queries:** When you type a prompt into the assistant, it is sent directly to the Groq API for processing. The content of your prompt is not saved or logged by the Extension after the response is delivered.

  * **Page Summarization:** When you use the "Summarize Page" feature, the text content of the current webpage is sent to the Groq API to generate a summary. This data is processed to create the summary and is not stored or logged by the Extension.

  * **Clipboard Access:** The "Paste from Clipboard" feature only reads the current content of your clipboard upon your explicit action. The Extension does not monitor your clipboard in the background or store its history.

  * **Stateless and Private by Design:** The Extension is designed to be stateless. It does not save, store, or log any of your prompts, conversation history, or personal data anywhere.

### Third-Party Services (Groq API)

To function, Shighra AI sends request data (such as your prompts or page content for summarization) to the Groq API. This is the only third-party service the Extension communicates with. We recommend you review Groq's own Privacy Policy for details on how they handle data.

### Policy Updates

This Privacy Policy reflects our current practices. If any future versions of the Extension change these data handling practices, this policy will be updated accordingly, and users will be notified via the Chrome Web Store.
